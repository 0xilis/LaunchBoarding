LaunchBoarding is a framework and Swift package for handling onboarding. It is currently in use in my project [Lina](https://github.com/0xilis/Lina). It can be used as an Objective-C framework, a Swift framework, and also a Swift Package.

Please note that LaunchBoarding is currently declared in beta, meaning some APIs may change.
